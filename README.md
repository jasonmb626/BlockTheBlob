## WELCOME HEROES!

No? Not a hero? No problem, we aren't picky! We are under attack by blobs! Despite their cute appearances, they are destructive. Please, help us!"

You can build in 8 directions onto an unoccupied spot. (The sneaky blobs can also move 8 ways too!) Surround us with your walls to save more people.

Outnumber and outsmart the blobs by building walls, the more walls you build, the better your chances are to save us.

(Don't worry! It's simple, but somehow we just can't do it!)
